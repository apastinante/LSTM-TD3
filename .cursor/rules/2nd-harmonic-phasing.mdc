Context & System Overview
- Domain: Particle accelerator physics, specifically synchrotron accelerators like the Proton Synchrotron Booster (PSB) at CERN
- System: Double-harmonic RF cavity system with 1st harmonic (h=1) and 2nd harmonic (h=2) operating simultaneously
- Key Variables:
- - Φ₂: Phase of the 2nd harmonic relative to the 1st harmonic (primary optimization variable)
- - V_t: Total voltage in the cavity (V1 + V2)
- - r = V₂/V₁: Voltage ratio between 2nd and 1st harmonic
- - ff: Filling factor of the particle distribution in the separatrix (doesn't change the potential well but changes how the profiles look)
- - φₛ: Synchronous phase angle (indicates how much the system is accelerating)
Core Physics Problem
- The accelerator uses RF cavities to accelerate charged particle beams through oscillating electric fields. In double-harmonic operation:
- - Single-harmonic limitations: Creates asymmetric potential wells, leading to non-uniform particle distributions
- - Double-harmonic benefits: Allows creation of flatter, more symmetric beam profiles through proper phasing
- Operating modes:
- - BSM (Bunch Shortening Mode): Φ₂ = π (with no other effects or imperfections)
- - BLM (Bunch Lengthening Mode): Φ₂ = 0 (with no other effects or imperfections)

Collective Effects & Instabilities
- Three main collective effects destabilize the beam:
- - Space Charge: Coulomb repulsion between particles causes beam spreading, more severe at low energies
- - Resistive Wall Impedance: Beam interaction with conducting vacuum chamber walls
- - Cavity Impedance/Beam Loading: Beam-induced electromagnetic fields in RF cavities
- These effects cause:
- - Beam profile asymmetry and non-uniform charge density (λφ)
- - Energy spread increase
- - Potential beam loss and instabilities
- - Reduced beam intensity capabilities

Solution Approach: 2nd Harmonic Phasing
- Goal: Optimize Φ₂ throughout the acceleration cycle to:
- - Flatten the longitudinal beam profile and make it as uniform as possible(line density λφ)
- - Minimize space charge effects by reducing dλφ/dt
- - Compensate for beam loading effects
- - Maintain symmetric separatrix and potential wells
- - Prevent beam instabilities and losses

Technical Implementation
- Simulation Tool: BLonD (Beam Longitudinal Dynamics) code

Problem Statement
- Design and verify an automated optimizer to compute the correct phase of the second harmonic Φ₂ throughout the acceleration cycle to compensate for space charge and beam loading effects, maintaining beam stability and optimal longitudinal profile characteristics.
